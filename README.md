### [View Demo](https://cosmicjs.com/apps/product-listings-app-with-personalization/demo)

This repository showcases the use of Angular with [Cosmic](cosmicjs.com), a headless CMS service, to create a ecommerce website customization sample. More information in [this article](https://dev.to/i_maka/build-an-ecommerce-app-with-personalization-using-angular-and-cosmic-js-48nh)

## How to install
1. Install demo content via the Cosmic website:
https://cosmicjs.com/apps/ecommerce-personalization

2. Install the code locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/cosmicjs/cosmic-commerce-filters
```

3. Once you've got your Cosmic Bucket installed, fill the data on the `environment` files as follows:
```
{
  production: true|false,
  read_key: 'COSMIC_READ_KEY',
  write_key: 'COSMIC_WRITE_KEY',
  bucket_slug: 'BUCKET_SLUG',
  URL: 'https://api.cosmicjs.com/v1/',
  presets: 'YOUR_PRESETS_OBJECT_SLUG'
}
```
The `cosmic interceptor` will make sure to send the read and write keys when communicating with the CMS.

You can also run the following command to quickstart the application:
```
COSMIC_BUCKET=your-bucket-slug COSMIC_WRITE_KEY=your-bucket-write-key COSMIC_READ_KEY=your-bucket-read-key npm start
```

# Angular CLI
